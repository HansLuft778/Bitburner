grow being 3.2x hacktime and weaken 4x hacktime
grow can not safely be distributed, cause:
    multiple instances cant finish at the same time, effect is calculated at the end, 
    thus if its spread across multiple instances they'll increase security for one another





firstWeakenThreads: 2 // um den hack wieder gut zu machen
serverGrowThreads: 589
secondWeakenThreads: 48
serverHackThreads: 4492

needs 8754.65GB of RAM and got 9581.7. Running parallel mode on the-hub
hackThreshold: 0.55

fix:
grow threads conservative calculation by adding the THRESHOLD_STEP on top -> will help when we overshoot the threshold target
first weak threads now take the security increase if the hack into account



predicted threads needed:
firstWeakenThreads: 121
serverGrowThreads: 2196
secondWeakenThreads: 176
serverHackThreads: 3016
